A name uttered with fear
No smile, no tears
They"ll crush your skull with a blow
And pile them in a row

The heart of Turisas was forged by four winds
In a smithy high up in the skies
On an anvil honour, with a hammer of blood
The Four Winds pounded

Battle Metal!
As the battle rages the dearest to you, you hold in your hand â€“
and stick in their lungs!

An iron gaze of a hawk
Out of sight they stalk
Their arrows cut the air an they fly
Death from the sky

Thunder in their eyes
A riding demise
Storming over the men on the field
Breaking their shield
